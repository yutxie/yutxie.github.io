### Personal Perspectives on AI Behavioral Science

On top of my [research interests](/#research), this page reflects some of my additional thoughts on `AI Behavioral Science`. Further details and community discussions about this emerging field can be found in our [perspective paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=5395006) and [recent workshops](https://ai-behavioral-science.github.io/).

### Why studying AI?

It's about the two ultimate goals of doing science and research:

* **To understand the world**: As AI enters the society and interacts with us, it becomes an inseparable part of the world around us. So to fully understand the world, one needs to understand AI.
* **To understand ourselves**: For the very first time in the history, humans have "cyber siblings". Posessing human-like (or even superhuman) intelligence, AI is a mirror that reflects on ourselves. 

### Why behavioral science (or why studying AI at the behavioral level)?

It provides a perfect scientific leverage:

* Behavior is **observable and measurable**.
* Behavior is **ubiquitous, a generalizable representation**:
    * For both humans and machines;
    * Across domains (e.g., economics, healthcare, education).
* Behavior comes from interactions. It **can be intervened and generate impact**, closing the causal loop.
* Behavior is at the **meso level**, bridging the micro level (e.g., neural networks, cognitive processes) and the macro level (e.g., social systems, ecological systems).
